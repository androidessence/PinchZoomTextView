PinchZoomTextView Library
=============

This library allows you to have a TextView that will grow/shrink the font size using gestures from the user.

Usage
-----

To have access to the library, add the dependency to your build.gradle:

```java
	compile 'com.androidessence:pinchzoomtextview:1.0.1'
```

Developer Notes
---------------

By default, the zoom feature is always enabled. If for any reason you want to disable it, simply call the `PinchZoomTextView#setZoomEnabled(boolean enabled)` method.

Sample
-----

To see the library in action, here is a sample of the text size changing:

<img src='sample.gif' width='400' height='640' />
